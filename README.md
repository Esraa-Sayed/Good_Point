# Toy Project
## Problem Statement
It is widely used for the purposes of security on the health of individuals, as it is used in cafes to search for individuals located in the place and count the number of people to insure the health of individuals and to ensure the distance between them and that their number is the appropriate number to prevent the spread of the disease such as Corona disease at the present time.
## Learning Process
We learned how to use <b>Open CV</b> to recognize the face of people and calculate their number  and also learned how to detected things from the picture as the coin or if a tree is found how to detect it and what is the things around it. we use pycharm as a tool to developed that.
 
# Coding Competition
## Problem Statement
The thought of a family member, a friend, or someone else you care about going missing can be terrifying. You don’t know where they are, if they’re hurt or if they need help. When this person lives with a mental health condition, the situation may be even more serious. Also, time required for finding lost person is may be long so, taking action quickly can make a difference.

## Solution
* Steps taken for solving the problem.
<br>First, parents that lose their child will add his/her picture in the application
then If anyone suspects that the child has been kidnapped or lost, he will open the application and the camera and point the camera at the child.
then the application compare between the child's photo and all the lost children's photos. If a match occurs, it will appear to the user that the child has been kidnapped.</br>

* Frameworks/Tools/Technologies stacks used.
<br>We use Pycharm framework(<b>Django</b> framework), <b>face recognition tools</b>, <b>Android Studio</b>, <b>PostgreSQL</b> Database</br>
We used <b>Django</b>  framework :-<br>
Where a lot of libraries are available to help us detect and recongize the faces.<br>
We used <b>PostgreSQL</b> Database :-<br>
Where it is suitable for us to update the data easier than <b>MySQL</b>.<br>
We used <b>Android Studio</b> :-<br>
This project can be converted into an application that anyone can use easily.

## Methodology 
  * Use Case:

  * Database: <b>PostgreSQL</b> SQLite.
  * <b>ML Kit</b> for Firebase (For real-time detection)
  * [Face Detection and Recognition Algorithms.docx](https://github.com/abdelrhman-mamdouh/J6_Hackathon_Jefive/files/7219037/Face.Detection.and.Recognition.Algorithms.docx)


## System Architecture proposal (if any)
Explain the following in detail:
  * Mobile Phone device to test our project by <b>Android Studio</b>.
  * ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63111171/134538831-76884e8e-fd1b-4ea3-b59b-e95fd5cc43df.png)
  * Before recognizing a face, it is first essential to detect and extract the faces from the original pictures. For recognizing a face, the algorithms compare only faces. Any       other element in the picture that is not part of a face deteriorates the recognition.

## Screenshots
* Attach relevant screenshots.

## Step to run the software
* Install <b>Python</b> 3.8.3
* Install <b>Django</b> Framework
* Install <b>face-recognition</b> library
* Install <b>Android Studio</b>
* Download <b>ngrok</b> tool to help you share a app running on your local machine with the world.
* Run app by <b>Android studio</b> and copy <b>ngrok</b> code to good point app.
